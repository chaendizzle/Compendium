Installation
============

It is impossible to create and use FRC software without installing it beforehand. Many of the most confusing problems can be solved simply by correctly re-installing incorrectly installed or corrupted software.
The Programming Team uses a wide variety of software tools, some more important than others, to help write code and control the robot. An overview of the software’s purpose and installation will be covered for each tool that is used.

I’m not going to reinvent the wheel here.
I’m often just going to provide links to the very helpful screenstepslive website, or download links.
I assume you’re smart enough to click the big download button and install software on your own.
