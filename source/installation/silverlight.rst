Silverlight
===========

All programming computers will need Internet Explorer and Silverlight to be able to see the RoboRIO dashboard.

`Download and install Silverlight. <https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/>`_

Note that Silverlight ONLY works in Internet Explorer, so when trying roborio-frc.local or 172.22.11.2, make sure to use Internet Explorer. Note that this is only true of modern browser versions, so if you're trying to work on linux, you can use a version of Firefox older than FF52.
