GitHub
=========

All programming computers will need GitHub to sync RobotCode with the repository.

Note that there are 2 versions of GitHub desktop at this time, one is a legacy version that tends to be faster and not eat a lot of resources, 
and the newer version (Desktop Beta), which has the benefit of linux (potential) compatibility (this isnt implemented as of yet, but is expected to be by the end of 2017).

Both versions can be found `here. <https://desktop.github.com/>`_
