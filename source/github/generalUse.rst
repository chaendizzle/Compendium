GitHub General Use
=============================


Creating a Github Repository
----------------------------

A *repository* is what GitHub calls a codebase that is stored and version controlled by GitHub.
Once you have created a GitHub account and joined the *Marinette Robtics Team* Organization, creating a new repository is simple. It is done by going to the Robotics Team page, and clicking the *New* button, and filling out the name of the Repository.

Write a detailed title and description of you commit, mentioning all changes made, any bugs fixed, and any potential issues, and click the "Commit to [branch]" button. (This will either be "Commit to master", or some other branch name. Branches are discussed `here. <branches.html>`_) Then, press the "Push origin" button in the upper bar to synchronize your commit.
